## Built With

<p>This app was build using MVVM-C architecture. Frameworks were integrated with Swift Package Manger. I've used Observer and Delegate paterns.</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>UIKit</li>
  <li>CoreLocation</li>
  <li>Hero</li>
    <li>Alamofire</li>
    <li>Dependency Injection</li>
    <li>XCode Instruments</li>
</ul>

<p>Alamofire was used for getting and parsing data from OpenWeather API. CoreLocation was used for getting gps data for passing in to OpenWeather API.
Hero was used for animated screen transitions</p>
